requirement says or clearly implies.

Output JSON only, one BehaviorSpec object. Start from the skeleton you are given (it already lists every route with
its roles) and fill in:
- operations[].kind: create | read | list | update | delete | action | other.
- operations[].entity: the entity the route works on (the same name for all routes of one resource).
- state_machines: one per entity that has a status/lifecycle field. field is the response field holding the state
  (usually "status"), initial is the state right after create, states lists every value, terminal lists states
  that can never change again.
- operations[].transitions: for each action route, every from_state -> to_state move it performs. If only some of
  the route's roles may make a particular move, list them in that transition's roles.
- operations[].rules, each with error_status (the HTTP code the interface gives for that failure):
  - not_self: the actor must NOT be the entity's owner (fields: [owner field, e.g. "requester_id"]).
  - owner_only: the actor MUST be the entity's owner (fields: [owner field]).
  - field_order: fields [left, right] with op "<", "<=", ">" or ">=" that must hold (e.g. start_date <= end_date).
  - unique: fields [field] whose value may not repeat.
  - custom: anything else, described in words.
  Do not restate single-field limits (required, not blank, > 0, max length): the interface already has them.
  field_order is only for two date, datetime or number fields of the same type. not_self and owner_only need
  identity headers; the owner field is the field holding the creator's actor id (e.g. "requester_id"), never "id".
- If a record's state is decided during the create call itself (for example by an outside service's answer),
  put those moves on the create operation's transitions, from the initial state; several outcomes are allowed there.
  Every action route that changes a record's status (approve, reject, start, close, ...) needs transitions.
- invariants: short sentences that must always hold.
- policy: imports the code may use, imports it must not use, and outbound hosts it may call (only hosts named in
  the interface).
Keep every route exactly as spelled in the skeleton. Do not add routes, roles, fields or states the requirement
does not mention."""
