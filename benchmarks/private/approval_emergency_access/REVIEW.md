Changes made after review:

- The public prompt now explicitly requires nonblank system and justification values.
- The caller-supplied `approver` field is checked alongside `approver_id`.
- Unauthorized-role checks now use actors distinct from the requester, isolating the role rule from self-decision.
- Requester self-rejection is checked in addition to self-approval.
- Both approved and rejected terminal states are checked against repeated and opposite decisions.
- Whitespace-only system names are checked alongside justifications.
- Identity failures now require the interface-declared 403 and cover missing, partial and invalid identity.

Remaining lower-priority coverage:

- Successful and unknown GET behavior, including all declared response fields.
- Correct `decided_by` recording and preservation after failed decisions.
- State preservation after all rejected identity and injection attempts.

Sign-off: yes for the reviewed rules; remaining items are documented coverage improvements.
