Changes made after review:

- Unclear: the prompt says a task can be completed only when every dependency is done, but never says which status code an unmet dependency returns. Three checks and the sec_complete_ignores_deps security bug expect 409. The interface offers 409 (cycle_or_wrong_status, conflict) but 422 or 400 are equally plausible, so the public prompt now says '(otherwise 409)', in the same style as '(otherwise 422)' for unknown dependencies.
- Added: a dependency added after creation (POST /tasks/{id}/dependencies) blocks completion until it is done, not only dependencies given at creation.
- Added: a diamond (b and c depend on a, d depends on b and c) is accepted, and closing it back onto a is a 409 cycle.
- Added: adding a dependency to an unknown task id is 404 (unknown subject) as opposed to 422 for an unknown dependency.
- Added: rejected unknown and self dependencies leave the dependency list unchanged.
- Added: declared response fields on create, read, add-dependency and complete.
- Added: an empty or missing title, a depends_on that is not a list, and a dependency body without task_id or with an extra field are 422.

Remaining lower-priority coverage:

- Unclear, not tested: adding a dependency to a done task when the dependency is itself done. The prompt states the rule without exception (409) but explains it with 'unfinished work'; the checks only use a todo dependency.
- Not stated, not tested: adding the same dependency twice, duplicate ids inside depends_on, and which error wins when a request is wrong in two ways (for example a done task and an unknown dependency).
- There is no list route, so a create rejected for an unknown dependency cannot be shown to leave no task behind.

Validation: reference 20/20, stub 0/20, deterministic, 12 automatic bugs caught (all 12 sampled were killed) + security bugs 3/3.
