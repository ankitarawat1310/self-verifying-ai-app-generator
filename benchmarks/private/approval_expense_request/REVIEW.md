Changes made after review:

- The public prompt now explicitly requires a nonblank description.
- The prompt now aligns with the private state machine by forbidding both self-approval and self-rejection.
- Self-rejection is tested in addition to self-approval.
- Both terminal states are tested against repeated and opposite decisions with state preservation.
- Whitespace-only descriptions are rejected explicitly.
- Identity failures now require the interface-declared 403 and cover missing, partial and invalid identity.

Remaining lower-priority coverage:

- Unknown GET behavior and validation of every declared response field.
- Submission attempts by a manager and read attempts using invalid roles.
- `decided_by` preservation after every failed terminal transition.

Sign-off: yes for the reviewed rules; remaining items are documented coverage improvements.


Addition after review (2026-09-24, Claude, from the Day 3 bug-generator gap list):

- `test_small_positive_amount_is_accepted`: a 0.5 amount must be accepted. The prompt says "a positive amount", and without this check a bug requiring amount > 1 went unnoticed. Needs reviewer sign-off.
