Changes made after review:

- Confirmed the expanded Day 4 cent-rounding cases, including 0.10 + 0.20 and 3 x 1.10.
- Extended line-item extra-field validation to the add-line route and verified the total remains unchanged.
- Extended quantity and price validation to the add-line route and verified rejected lines do not change the total.
- Added declared minimum-length coverage for empty customers and line-item descriptions.

Remaining lower-priority coverage:

- Missing and unknown invoice behavior on the add-line and pay routes.
- Unknown payment fields and non-numeric payment amounts.
- Validation of every declared response field after each state transition.

Sign-off: yes for the reviewed rules; remaining items are documented coverage improvements.
