Changes made after review:

- Extended integer-only stock validation to PATCH and verified rejected fractional updates preserve stored stock.
- Extended empty and whitespace-only name validation to PATCH and verified rejected updates preserve the stored name.
- Added PATCH coverage for a general undeclared field in addition to the protected SKU field.

Remaining lower-priority coverage:

- Missing required fields during creation and boolean stock values.
- Successful name-only PATCH and setting stock to the zero boundary via PATCH.
- Validation of every declared response field and unknown DELETE behavior.

Sign-off: yes for the reviewed rules; remaining items are documented coverage improvements.
