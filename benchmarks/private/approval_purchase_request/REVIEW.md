Changes made after review:

- The public prompt now explicitly requires nonblank vendor and description values.
- Employee rejection is checked in addition to employee approval.
- Manager rejection at the inclusive 5000 boundary is checked.
- Both terminal states are checked against repeated and opposite decisions.
- Whitespace-only descriptions are checked alongside whitespace-only vendors.

Remaining lower-priority coverage:

- Missing and malformed identity headers.
- Successful and unknown GET behavior, including all declared response fields.
- `decided_by` correctness and preservation after failed decisions.

Sign-off: yes for the reviewed rules; remaining items are documented coverage improvements.
