Changes made after review:

- Confirmed the Day 4 boundary coverage accepts both 0.5 kg and the inclusive 100 kg maximum.
- Extended non-numeric connector-price coverage to reject JSON booleans as well as strings, with no stored result.

Remaining lower-priority coverage:

- Malformed JSON and non-object connector replies.
- Non-finite numeric prices such as NaN or infinity, if the product contract chooses to forbid them explicitly.
- Validation of every declared response field in both create and list responses.

Sign-off: yes for the reviewed rules; remaining items are documented coverage improvements.
