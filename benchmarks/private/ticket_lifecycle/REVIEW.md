Changes made after review:

- No existing check needed correcting. Verified the queue item: other-customer reopen coverage exists (test_other_customer_cannot_reopen: 403 and the ticket stays resolved).
- Added the missing-identity coverage the interface requires (missing_or_wrong_identity: 403): no headers, id only, role only and an unknown role are exactly 403 on all six routes and change nothing.
- Added the role matrix: only customers can open tickets; managers cannot start, resolve or close; agents cannot close.
- Added the 409 cases that were missing: reopening an open or in-progress ticket, and starting or resolving a resolved or closed ticket, with the status unchanged.
- Added a full lifecycle after a manager reopen: the ticket is resolved and closed again by its original requester, and another customer still gets 403.
- Added: declared response fields on open, read and every transition, with reads allowed for customer, agent and manager; 404 on every route for an unknown ticket (test_unknown_ticket_is_404 only covered start); empty or missing title and description are 422.

Remaining lower-priority coverage:

- Unclear, not tested: whether a manager may reopen a resolved ticket (the interface says 'requesting customer or agent', the prompt does not exclude managers) or reopen an open or in-progress ticket.
- Not stated, not tested: whether a customer may read another customer's ticket (GET lists the customer role without an ownership rule).
- Not stated: which error wins when both the role and the status are wrong (403 or 409). The checks never combine the two.
- Undeclared fields other than status and requester_id on open rely on the shared unknown_body_field convention only.

Validation: reference 21/21, stub 0/21, deterministic, 11 automatic bugs caught + security bugs 3/3. The one surviving automatic mutant (min_length=1 removed) is equivalent: the not-blank validator on the same fields also rejects empty strings.
