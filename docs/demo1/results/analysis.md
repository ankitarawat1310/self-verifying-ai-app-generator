## Paired comparisons (exact McNemar, same task and repeat)

| Pair | Outcome | Pairs | Only first | Only second | p |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M0 vs M1 | passes all hidden checks | 45 | 1 | 11 | 0.0063 |
| M0 vs M1 | shipped broken app | 45 | 10 | 5 | 0.3018 |
| M0 vs M2 | passes all hidden checks | 45 | 4 | 10 | 0.1796 |
| M0 vs M2 | shipped broken app | 45 | 8 | 9 | 1.0 |
| M1 vs M2 | passes all hidden checks | 45 | 8 | 4 | 0.3877 |
| M1 vs M2 | shipped broken app | 45 | 6 | 12 | 0.2379 |

## Failed hidden checks by cause

| Cause | M0 | M1 | M2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| App did not start | 36 | 30 | 44 |
| Server crash (500) or no valid response | 54 | 22 | 83 |
| Accepts invalid or unknown input (2xx, expected 422) | 29 | 22 | 13 |
| Missing permission check (2xx, expected 403) | 3 | 4 | 8 |
| Missing conflict or state rule (2xx, expected 409) | 5 | 1 | 0 |
| Outside-service error not handled (expected 502) | 5 | 6 | 15 |
| Identity treated as validation (422, expected 403) | 7 | 2 | 0 |
| Rejects valid requests (4xx, expected 2xx) | 11 | 3 | 10 |
| Wrong response shape (missing key, wrong type) | 16 | 6 | 7 |
| Other wrong status code | 11 | 7 | 3 |
| Wrong value or state | 0 | 0 | 2 |

Note: a failed create often makes later checks fail with a missing key, so 'wrong response shape' includes cascades.
